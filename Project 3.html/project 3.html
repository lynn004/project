  <h2>About</h2>
  <hr> 
  <p>I'm a writer still in training based in Kenya and writing has always been my passion ever
     since I was little.I take lots of pride in writing since it takes one to a whole new world full
     of fantasies where we all get to write our own stories just the way one would like to put it.
     Besides writing I also enjoy other activities such as listening to music since I've always
     considered music to be my source of inspiration.I also love travelling a lot because it's always
     an opportunity to explore different regions in the world and learn about whole new stuff which is
     very much exciting!

   <h2>Poetry</h2>
   <p>With poetry, it's a quite and calm way of expressing thoughts and emotions hence something
    I really love to do.
   </p>
   <h2>Here's a sample of a poem I wrote:</h2>
   <p>The salty droplets <br>
      The bright smile <br>
      The beautiful pictures <br>
      The cheeky words <br>
      The playful nature <br>
      All have something beneath <br>
      A hug to embrace <br>
